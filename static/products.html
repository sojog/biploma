                    <p>Education plays a pivotal role in building and evolving a knowledge-based society by ensuring the
                        competencies necessary for the century we live in. It stands as a key tool that can shape a
                        country's
                        socio-economic trajectory.</p><br>

                    <p>The Ministry of Education in Romania has consistently pursued the integration of technology into
                        educational
                        activities, launching investment programs for the modernization and equipping of schools with
                        ICT
                        facilities
                        and promoting computer-assisted learning and teaching systems.</p><br>

                    <p>Certiblock™ and the Romanian Ministry of Education have successfully collaborated to enhance
                        Romania's
                        educational system since 2004, beginning with an agreement that supported the top 200 high
                        schools
                        in
                        Romania to become accredited Certiblock™ testing centers. The collaboration also aimed to
                        incorporate
                        the
                        Certiblock™ program into the pre-university curriculum.</p><br>

                    <p>In 2011, the "Education for the Information Society" partnership continued the strategy of
                        implementing
                        Certiblock™ certification in Romanian education, this time aligning with the objectives set
                        forth in
                        the
                        National Pact for Education and the "Education and Research for the Knowledge Society" strategy.
                        Through
                        this agreement, "The Ministry of Education, Research, Youth, and Sports recognizes the
                        Certiblock™
                        certification, the European Computer Driving License, based on Certiblock™ standards, as a
                        computer
                        operator
                        certificate valid within the educational system."</p><br>
                    <p>The Certiblock™ license offers significant benefits to students and teachers alike:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Certiblock™ license does not expire.</li>
                        <li>The Certiblock™ registration series is unique and does not have a limited period of
                            validity.

                        <li>Any type of Certiblock™ license is internationally recognized.</li>
